                  So My name is Abdi Omari, I am a web enthusiast probably obsessed with everything Tech.
                  I am a professional Web developer, with deep interest in web and software development as well as                   API's. 
        
                  Some of the interesting things I have taught myself include:
                         
                         
                          class Developer:
                              def __init__(self,title,experience,stack):
                                  self.title = "Junior Developer" 
                                  self.experience = "2.5"
                                  self.stack = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'TailwindCSS', 'React', 'Python', 'Django',                                                          'Laravel']
                                  self.otherSkills = ['APIs', 'Product design', 'project management', 'Cloud                                                            services'}
                              
                              def Introduction(self):
                                  print(f"I am a {self.title} with {self.experience} years worth of experience." )
                                  
             I am open to any project ideas, discussions, Job offers, collaboration as well as basic networking.
